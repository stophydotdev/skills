# stophy jobs

Search and read job postings on LinkedIn and Upwork.

**Prerequisite:** every command here needs `stophy login --browser` or `STOPHY_API_KEY`. See [stophy](../stophy/SKILL.md).

## Quick start

```bash
# roles by keyword and location, with workplace and experience filters
stophy linkedin jobs search "product manager" --location "New York" --json -o .stophy/linkedin-jobs.json

# freelance work by rate type and experience
stophy upwork search "react developer" --jobType hourly --experience intermediate --json -o .stophy/upwork.json

# one posting in full, by ID or link from a search result
stophy linkedin jobs job "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3812345678" --json -o .stophy/job.json
```

Run `stophy <source> --help` for every command. The sources here are `linkedin` and `upwork`.

**Done when:** you name the specific role, company, pay, and posting link. A generic summary of "several openings" is not enough.

## Tips

- Search first to get a job ID or link, then run `job` on it for the full description and requirements.
- `upwork search` costs 2 credits per call. `upwork job` and `linkedin jobs` cost 1.
- LinkedIn jobs live under `linkedin jobs`. `linkedin posts` and `linkedin profile` cover people and companies, and belong to stophy-social.
