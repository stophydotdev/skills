# youtube-comments

Read comments and replies for a YouTube video.

## Choose this skill when

- The user asks what people/viewers/commenters are saying.
- The user wants reactions, objections, praise, complaints, or customer language from comments.
- The user needs top comments, latest comments, or replies in a thread.

Use `youtube-transcript` for spoken content. Use `youtube-video` for metadata.

## Commands

```bash
# Top comments
stophy video comments --url "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6ukrWyqOm4" --sortBy top

# Latest comments
stophy video comments --url "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6ukrWyqOm4" --sortBy latest

# More comments from a previous response
stophy video comments --url "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6ukrWyqOm4" --continuation-token <token>

# Replies to a comment thread
stophy video replies --continuation-token <repliesToken>
```

## Options

| Option | Values | Use when |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `--url <url>` | YouTube video URL | Required for comments |
| `--sortBy <sort>` | top, latest | Choose popular or recent comments |
| `--continuation-token <token>` | string | Fetch more comments or replies |
| `--json` | — | Pipe or parse raw JSON |

## Response shape

`comments` returns `comments[]` with fields such as:

- `text`
- `author`
- `likeCount`
- `publishedAt`
- `repliesToken`

Pass `repliesToken` to `stophy video replies` to load the full thread.

## Output guidance

- For research tasks, group comments by theme and include representative quotes.
- Preserve `repliesToken` when the user may want to inspect a thread.
- Use `--sortBy top` for highest-signal reactions; use `--sortBy latest` for recent discussion.
- Do not claim comments represent all viewers. Frame findings as “comments surfaced by the API”.
